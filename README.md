2 Summery of the project

2.1 Project presentation

Since my teenage years I have been very organized in what I do and this inspired me to create The
Event Planner. An app for those who like myself like being organized and want to plan and organize
their own event. The events I am thinking of including are Wedding, Baby-shower, Hen Party,
Anniversary, Birthday, Conference, Funeral...Why not?! For each particular event I would have its
own color palette and fonts. In this project I will be doing the Wedding Planner.
Every girl loves planning their own wedding and have her own personal touch. She would have the
possibilities to manage everything from her hair and dress fitting appointments to guests list,
invitations, photos she takes for samples for the dress, hair, design etc. She would be able to send
invitation to the guests, post pictures of the wedding and share those with them.

2.2 Objective

The objective of the project is to allow to people to plan with ease their own event(s). Whether it be
Birthday, Anniversary, Hen Party, Baby-shower and many more. And it will be the Event Planner that
will help them to stay well organized and on track. They will be able to manage and have all from one
place whenever they are without worrying they might forget something or a sticky note might be lost
somewhere.

2.3 Target

The main targets of the app are all people who wants to organize their own event.
