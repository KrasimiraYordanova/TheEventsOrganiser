Since my teenage years I have been very organized in everything I do and this inspired me to create The
Events Organiser. An app for those who, like myself, like being organized and want to plan their own event. 
The events I am including are Wedding, Baby-shower, Hen Party,
Anniversary, Birthday, Conferenc, Gala. 
You can create the event, send invitation(token) to guests so he can fill a form with his/her information, his/her diet
wether vehan, vegeterian etc... And because not everyone is computer savy, the even creator himself can fill 
that information for the guest. Youc can create tables, name them and insert yout guests to whichever table you wish
so you will know how many tables you are going to have for your event. There is a budget tracker. For every expense you make
there is a tracker. A toDo list and many more
The functionalities I will apply in the future are calander so you can take an appointment in a particular date and themes. 
I would like to use to be able to change its theme color.

 - Objective

The objective of the project is to allow to people to plan with ease their own event(s). Whether it be
Birthday, Anniversary, Hen Party, Baby-shower and many more. And it will be the Event Planner that
will help them stay well organized and on track. They will be able to manage and have all from one
place whenever they are without worrying they might forget something or a sticky note might be lost
somewhere.

 - Target

The main targets of the app are all people who wants to organize their own event.
